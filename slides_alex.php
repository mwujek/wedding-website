				<h3>Laura Masterson Whalen</h3>
				<h4>The Fearless Leader</h4>
				<p>As Alexandra's older sister and Friend Who Has Known Her The Very Longest (closely rivaled by her practically adopted younger sister, Allison Rost [link]), Laura feels pretty emotional and jazzed for the upcoming nuptials. She's been busy daydreaming about her wedding toast, and then adjusting personal expectations for said wedding toast from the moment she saw Alex and Matt's engagement instagram story.</p>

				<p>Laura loves dinner parties, not windy beaches, nerdy political podcasts, stealing the bride-to-be's clothing, and chilling with her husband and two babies. She also likes wine... and pasta (preferably paired together).</p>

				<h3>Michelle Fox</h3>
				<h4>The Fashionista</h4>
				<p>Michelle is a great friend of Alex’s from San Francisco. They became close while enduring many strenuous backpacking trips together in which Alex had periodical breakdowns and Michelle championed on forward as the true wilderness warrior that she is. They have also bonded over our weekly viewings of “The Bachelor”.</p>

				<p>When Michelle is not camping or binge watching garbage TV, she loves to cook vegetarian food, sew, and embroider: giving her the hobbies of a 1950s housewife.</p>

				<h3>Mandy</h3>
				<h4>Maid of Honor</h4>
				<p>Amanda aka Mandy aka Minty is another friend from San Francisco who now lives in Portland, Oregon. Mandy and Alex met through their significant others who were childhood best friends and roommates in San Francisco. After meeting, they quickly bonded over their shared love of 90’s karaoke songs and wine and boys from Walla Walla.</p> 

				<p>At the wedding, you’ll likely find Mandy tearing up the dance floor and/or making friends in the bathroom line. She also is known for hiding burritos, pizza slices, taquitos and more in the back of refrigerators at parties for late night snacking purposes. Good luck finding a fridge at the wedding, Minty!</p>

				<h3>Erin</h3>
				<h4>The Disney Enthusiast</h4>
				<p>Erin (or Fe as we lovingly call her), has been a loyal friend to Alex since high school. Introduced by Laura Durham, Alex + Fe quickly bonded with rides through local Louisville parks, Harry Potter viewings and being “adults” in Louisville for a few years after Erin graduated college.</p>

				<p>Erin likes cheesy pasta, broccoli and beer. Erin has two cats, a dog, a new baby and a stepson and a heart so big and swollen with love, it could burst. In her spare time, she works on renovating her family’s new home and playing with baby Owen!</p>

				<h3>Laura D.</h3>
				<h4>Maid of Honor</h4>
				<p>Laura and Alex’s friendship goes back to over ten years to their glory days in their high school theater program. In Alex’s debut performance at Walden, she played Laura’s daughter and they immediately jump started a quirky friendship that was built on a love of art, music and bad taste in boys. Over the years, Laura moved to Indiana, Kentucky again and then Illinois; whereas Alex moved to Massachusetts, Kentucky again and then California. They’ve beat the odds and stayed close friends.</p>

				<p>Laura loves good theatre, orange theory and a good road trip. Most weekends, Laura spends time with Chicago family who are all rad and way too cool and way too nice. (Alex loves you all!)</p>

				<h3>Allison</h3>
				<h4>The Glow Creator</h4>
				<p>The story of Alex + Allison dates back to 1990 when Allison was born and was bored and lonely and just waiting around for some crazy chick to join her crew. Luckily, she didn’t have to wait long, because just a month later Alex was born. Together, they shared a love of mac and cheese, Mary Kate and Ashley and conducting far too many fake wedding ceremonies with Allison as the officiant. Allison is the yin to Alex’s yang and will forever be a soul sister.</p>

				<p>In her spare time Allison enjoys making neon signs, embroidery and her cat Steve. On top of this she is now studying to be licensed to stick people with needles despite her ironic fear of said needles.</p>
